FM-WorkingWithBase64
===========
FileMaker 13 introduces a couple new functions, Base64Decode and Base64Encode. Base64 is a commonly used method of encoding binary data as text. For example, it is a standard means of attaching files to email. When you attach a file to an email to send to a friend, your email application can encode the raw file as text using Base64.

This example file explores the new functions and shows how to begin using them.
